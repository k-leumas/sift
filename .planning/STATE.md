# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-02)

**Core value:** Every incoming email is auto-labelled correctly or explicitly held for the owner, entirely on local hardware, with a decision trace explaining why.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Foundation and Isolation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Locked decisions (ADR-0001/0002/0003) are in PROJECT.md `<decisions>`; full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Every mail-derived table has non-null `mailbox_id` + RLS from Phase 1 (ADR-0001 wins over README "shared"/"synthetic" wording)
- [Init]: Bridge spike sits in Phase 2, ahead of ingest and label application, because its findings shape both
- [Init]: M1 has no classifier and no UI; traces are read via CLI or SQL
- [Init]: M1 traces reserve a classifier span marked skipped ("not trained") so M2 does not change the trace layout (TRC-06)
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: @types/node pinned at 26.6.3, the newest 26.x past the 7-day minimumReleaseAge gate
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: Biome 2.5 uses rules.preset recommended (boolean recommended is deprecated) and !dir folder negations
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: Root tsconfig sets allowJs+checkJs so root .js config files are type-checked
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: Commits run lefthook (biome pre-commit, commitlint commit-msg); header/body lines <=100 chars, never --no-verify
- [Phase 01]: 01-02: bootstrap ALTER ROLE re-asserts full role attributes on every run (repairs drift) and RAISEs on missing/empty password env
- [Phase 01]: 01-02: vector is created by the superuser in template1 so sift_test_* databases inherit it; sift_app is created by sift migrate, not the bootstrap

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Proton Bridge CONDSTORE/QRESYNC support and Message-ID consistency across label folders are unverified; polling fallback must work without either
- [Phase 3]: Raw LLM prompt retention limit (ADR-0003 open item) to decide when the `decision` table shape is set
- [Later]: How shared rules and synthetic eval runs fit under non-null `mailbox_id` (INGEST-CONFLICTS INFO) is deferred to M4/M5 planning
- [Init]: No `.planning/config.json` exists; roadmap assumed `standard` granularity and `sequential` phase IDs

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:

| Scope | README milestones M2-M7 (Learn, Plain-English rules, Evals, Multiple mailboxes, Guardrails, Extras) | Backlog | 2026-10-02 | v0.1 |
